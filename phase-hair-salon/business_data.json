Everyone seemed very nice when I made an appointment for today.\n\nUnfortunately I have a stammer and some people can struggle at times. Kath was my stylist and she was lovely, kind and patient. She discussed exactly how I would like my new haircut and made suggestions and told me if I didn't like the first way she did it she would change it around.\n\nI now have a really stylist, modern but very age appropriate style.  I honestly couldn't be happier or more delighted.\n\nThe bill really surprised me I expected it to be far more expensive than it was.\n\nWouldn't hesitate to recommend Kath to anyone, as long as I can still get an appointment with her.",
