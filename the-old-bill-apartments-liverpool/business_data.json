Beds were comfortable and fresh, always nice to see! To my surprise there was a quite big TV which is a big bonus! Not to mention that the place is really close to the town! Enjoyed my stay here and would definitely come back!",

Very modern and beautifully decorated with lots of space and in a great central location. The owners have done a truly outstanding job restoring the old place to a very high standard! Very very reasonably priced and spotlessly clean, cannot fault it at all it should have 10 stars!",

It was a 5 minute drive to the city centre and a short walk to Anfield Stadium which help a lot so you don’t have to drive there and saved a lot of hassle. The owner were very helpful when I had any general questions, I’m definitely staying on my return to Liverpool. Highly recommend by me and my friends. Thanks again...\n\nDavid",
