The bathroom also was not clean, again hairs on the toilet. The room also had only one plug socket.\nThe receptionist was very helpful and switched rooms with no issues. The new room was cleaner, but had a broken n light fitting with cobwebs. The whole hotel is very dated, and tired and in need of a refurbishment . Despite staying mid week for work, the hotel is extremely noisy, constantly has people smoke right outside the entrance,  you can hear people’s conversations in the rooms next to you. Not ideal when you’re up early for work!\nThe only positive I can say about this hotel is the staff, they are helpful friendly and polite!\n\nIf you’re in need of a budget hotel the Dolby in the same car park (although dated is at least clean!)",

Good water pressure for a nice shower. Restaurant is cozy and has everything you need. Parking costs overnight which is not great. Nice views of the docks.\n\nOverall a pleasant cheap experience.",

Room was clean but scruffy & tired.\n\nStaff were friendly and the location was ideal for the Arena.\n\nBreakfast was mediocre (we pre-paid for the 2 mornings we were there but didn’t bother on the second morning & went elsewhere). There was a staff member wiping down tables then shaking off her cloth next to where people were eating which wasn’t great.\n\nPersonally I wouldn’t stay here if I was on my own. The restaurant & reception is in a building next door to where the rooms are and there’s no security to the outside door of the hotel room block. It’s an automatic door and anyone can walk in off the street - don’t need to use your key card to get in for example and no staff member present like at reception.\n\nThis wasn’t a cheap hotel to book and I definitely wouldn’t stay again.",
